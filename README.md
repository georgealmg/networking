# networking

Hello!

My name is Jorge and I'm a pythonist and network engineer, I use python to manage a large network of devices using multiple libraries.

I have felt such a strong passion for Python that it is inspiring me to learn more that ever before, my goal is to keep learning and become a data scientist!
